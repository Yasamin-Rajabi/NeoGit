## Overview

NeoGit is a from-scratch, command-line implementation of a simplified version control system, inspired by Git. Built entirely in C, this project was the capstone assignment for the Fundamentals of Programming course, designed to deepen understanding of core software engineering concepts like file I/O, memory management, data structures, and system-level programming.

This project is not a wrapper around Git; it is a custom implementation that manages its own internal state and file structure to track changes across commits, branches, and more.
